# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
This courses allowed for us to develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. We learned the value of utilizing software design templates as well as how to utilize them to solve problems.

# Scenario 
You work for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant. Your client, The Gaming Room, currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android Systems. 

Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game _Win, Lose or Draw_, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle, the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. 

Your client is interested in expanding their gaming app to multpleplatforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment. Specifically, before making a decision, The Gaming Room has asked for you to evaluate the three tradi±onal operatng platorms (Linux, Mac, andWindows), as well as mobile platorms, for how the game applica±on software could be deployed and run and what would be required to do so.
